Answer 1: What is the forecasted heart rate for Day 67?

The forecasted heart rate for Day 67 (October 6, 2025) is 72.04 bpm with a 95% confidence interval of [65.5, 78.25] bpm.

Answer 2: What does the confidence interval tell you?

The 95% confidence interval [65.5, 78.25] bpm tells us that we can be 95% confident the true heart rate on Day 67 will fall within this range of approximately Â±6.4 bpm around our prediction. This interval accounts for natural variation in heart rate, model estimation uncertainty, and unpredictable factors such as stress, exercise, or illness. The relatively narrow interval width indicates strong model confidence, which is consistent with our low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.639 bpm, demonstrating that the Prophet model effectively captured the underlying patterns in the heart rate data.
